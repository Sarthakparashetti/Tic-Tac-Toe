Hello, this is my personal portfolio website which includes HTML, CSS and part of bootstrap. This website has a Home page, About page, Skill page, Social page and a Contact us page.

Key features:

    Free and frequently updated
    Include the last language standard concepts and features
    Practical teaching: small structured descriptions associated with code
    Minimal code examples for showing just a specific feature or issue without digressing
    Complementary language aspects: tools, coding conventions, project organization, and code optimization
    Experience-based: many aspects, examples, and problems come from real-world cases faced during my work as software engineer
